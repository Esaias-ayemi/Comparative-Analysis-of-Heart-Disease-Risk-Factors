# Comparative-Analysis-of-Heart-Disease-Risk-Factors

## Overview
This project presents an interactive dashboard designed to analyze heart disease risk factors based on a sample dataset. The dashboard provides key insights into how factors such as age, gender, diabetes, and smoking contribute to heart disease prevalence.

## Key Features
Demographic Analysis – Breakdown of patients by age and gender.
Risk Factor Comparison – Visualization of heart disease prevalence among smokers and diabetics.
Statistical Insights – Mean, median, and skewness analysis of age distribution.
Data Visualization – Graphs and charts representing key findings.
Interactive Elements – Filters and drill-down options for in-depth exploration.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is a sample and should not be used for future predictions. Analysts should validate findings with real-world data.
The data is gotten from Kaggle [download here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oktayrdeki/heart-disease)

## Tech Stack
Excel (Specify which tool you used)

## Key Findings
A higher percentage of the 2,000 confirmed heart disease patients are female.
Diabetes is a stronger independent risk factor for heart disease than smoking.
Diabetic non-smokers have a higher risk of heart disease than smokers without diabetes.
Diabetic smokers face the highest risk, with 490 confirmed cases in the dataset.
